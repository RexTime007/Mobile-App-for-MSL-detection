# Mobile-App-for-MSL
Mobile app developed to archive the grade of Computer Systems Engineer which identifies gestures from uploaded videos to a Flask-based server through an Android-based app to identify whether a sign is part of an alphabet or not.

DTW model was based on [Gabriel Guerin's work](https://github.com/gabguerin/Sign-Language-Recognition--MediaPipe-DTW/) which was modified to work as a web server using several videos instead of a real-time streaming input.
